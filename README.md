## About
This is a student management REST-API which was built using python Flask and Flask-smorest that enables users to add students,courses and grade the students as well.
The application can be used for the following:

## Features
- Register students into the school's system
- Create new users to manage the application
- Administrators and users can add or register students. Student ID and password will be automatically generated once they are registered
- Students can login with Student ID and password provided upon registeration
- Administrators of the application can add a new course to which students can later login to enroll for the course of thier choice
- Administrators and users of the application can add scores for students based on the courses they are enrolled under. 
- This application automatically calculates the grades and GPA of students once a student is registered and enrolls for a course or courses
- All courses should have a code which students will use to enroll. E.g A Computer Science course can have a course code as CS001
- Once logged in, a student can view all available courses to enroll for, he or she can view all the course enrolled under as well as the grades for each course
- Students can also view thier basic details or information, request for a password change if forgotten, and also be able to change thier passwords.
- All other routes except enrolling for a course can be accessed by an Administrator.
- However, a user who is not an administrator has some restrictions like deleting a student or course.
- This application also enables the user to retrieve all students and all courses. One can also view a student by his or her ID and also view a course by its code
- You can also view all the students enrolled for a particular course as well as all the courses a particular student has enrolled for
- All the grades of each student for a particular course can also be retrieved. A student can also retrieve all the grades for all the courses they have enrolled for
- Students can view thier GPA. However, users and administrators can view the GPA of all students

## Installation and Usage
- To try this application, you can either clone and run it locally on your PC or visit the site [here](https://students-management-system-api.herokuapp.com/) to check it out.

- Follow the steps below to run and test the application locally

## How to run the app locally
1. Clone this app
```
git clone https://github.com/kojosimtema/students-management-system-api.git
``` 
2. cd to the root directorate of the project and create your virtual environment
```
cd student-management-api

python -m venv env_name
``` 
3. Activate your virtual environment
```
source env_name/Scripts/activate "for windows"
``` 
```
source env_name/bin/activate "for linus and MacOS"
``` 
4. Install all packages from the requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 


## Usage
**Before you run the application, do the following:**

**1. In the run.py file remove the *"config=config_dict['prod']"* argument from the create_app function as below to run in development mode**
```
from api import create_app
from api.main.config.config import config_dict

app = create_app(config=config_dict['prod'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
```
from api import create_app
from api.main.config.config import config_dict

app = create_app()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
**2. Navigate to api/main/config and comment line 7 to 9, line 64 to 67 and uncomment line 68 in the config.py file**
```
import os
from decouple import config
from datetime import timedelta

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))

uri = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL') #or other relevant config var
if uri.startswith('postgres://'):
    uri = uri.replace('postgres://', 'postgresql://', 1)

```
```
import os
from decouple import config
from datetime import timedelta

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))

#uri = config('DATABASE_URL') #or other relevant config var
#if uri.startswith('postgres://'):
#    uri = uri.replace('postgres://', 'postgresql://', 1)

```
**3. Create the database using flask shell as follows;**
- Set the flask app

```
export FLASK_APP=api/
```
```
flask shell

db.create_all()
```
**4. Run the application to get started**
```
flask run
``` 
or 
```
python run.py
``` 

Once the application is running, you can start testing it with the following admin credentials
- **username: superadmin**
- **password: password**

- Login as an admin to get a JWT token. Once you add the token to authorization header to can go ahead and create a new user or student.
- You can also view students already added in the system. All other routes can b tested once you are logged in as an admin
- If you need to perform as task as a student (eg. enroll for a course) you'll need to login as a student to do that.
- You can go ahead and create a new student to get the student ID and password.

You can visit the app [here](https://students-management-system-api.herokuapp.com/) as well to test the already hosted application with the same credentials provided above.
